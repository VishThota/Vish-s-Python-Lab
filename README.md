#### <strong> Vish-s-Python-Lab </strong>
My Python Lab 6 - A Journey Through Python Basics
## Short description
This repository contains the Python code for Lab 6, which marks my first hands-on experience with Python after installing Anaconda. This lab was crucial in helping me understand the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

### Getting Started
This section provides instructions on how to get a local copy of the project up and running on your own machine.

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Anaconda installed. Anaconda is a distribution that includes Python and many other libraries that help with data science and analysis projects. You can download and install it from [Anaconda's official site](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

#### Installing
Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up your project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishThota/Vish-s-Python-Lab.git
2. Navigate to the repository folder: Change your directory to the cloned repository:
   cd Vish's-Python-Lab
3. Launch Anaconda Navigator: Open Anaconda Navigator through your start menu or command line. From the Navigator, launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open the Notebook: In Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the .ipynb file to access the Python Lab 6 notebook.

### Data Files
This project utilizes several CSV files for data manipulation and analysis tasks performed in the Jupyter notebook. Below is a description of each file and its role in the project:

- **census.csv**: Contains demographic data used to demonstrate data filtering and aggregation techniques.
- **licenses.csv**: Includes information about various licenses, used to illustrate join operations and data merging methods.
- **wards.csv**: Provides data on administrative divisions, used for geographic data manipulations and visualizations.

#### How to Use the Data Files
1. Ensure that you have cloned the repository with the data files as described in the "Installing" section.
2. When running the notebook, the code will reference these files to load data, so make sure they are in the same directory as the notebook, or adjust the file paths in the notebook accordingly.
3. Explore and manipulate the data as demonstrated in the notebook, or extend the analyses with your own questions and methods.

These files are essential for completing the exercises and examples detailed in the Python notebook.


### Running the Tests
This section explains how to run the tests associated with the Python notebook, if applicable. The notebook for Lab 6 primarily focuses on learning and experimenting with Python basics, and may not include formal automated tests. However, you can manually test the code by running each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to ensure the outputs are as expected.

#### How to Run
To test the Python code:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda Navigator as previously described.
2. Navigate to the cell you wish to test and ensure that any input data or parameters are correctly set up.
3. Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` or using the 'Run' button in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
4. Observe the output right below the cell to verify the correctness of the code execution.

#### What to Look For
- **Correctness**: Verify that the outputs are correct and error-free.
- **Functionality**: Test different inputs to see how the code responds. Ensure it handles various scenarios gracefully.
- **Performance**: For more complex functions, consider the execution time and resource usage.

This manual testing process will help ensure that the functionalities demonstrated in the notebook perform as intended.


### Deployment
This project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that is intended for educational and learning purposes and is not typically deployed in a production environment. However, here are some general notes on how to utilize or further develop the notebook for personal use or exploration:

1. **Exploration**: Use the notebook to explore further Python functionalities by modifying the code or adding new code cells.
2. **Integration**: Consider integrating the notebook with other Python scripts or projects for more complex analysis or data processing.
3. **Sharing**: You can share your findings or enhancements by pushing updates to this GitHub repository or by sharing the notebook in educational forums or with peers.

#### General Tips:
- Ensure that any personal data or sensitive information is removed or anonymized before sharing the notebook.
- Keep your Anaconda environment updated to support all the dependencies the notebook might require.

This approach to 'deployment' is about enhancing and sharing your learning experience rather than traditional software deployment.
